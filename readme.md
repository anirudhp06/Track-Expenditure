# Expenditure Program

Hi there! This is a simple program that allows you to keep track of your expenses. It is written in Java and uses the Swings library for the GUI.

I wanted to keep track on where I have spent money while i am studying.
1) You can argue that now a days most of purchases are online and can be tracked easily, but I wanted to keep track of my expenses in a more traditional way & due to increase of many [UPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Payments_Interface) apps, it really becomes difficult to keep track of all the expenses.

2. Now you can say that you can use online internet banking to see the trancactions, but I am not that confident on security of Internet banking as my bank account is just behind 1 username & password.

## This is just alpha version of program.
1. As of now this program uses oracle 10g DB and its really tiring setting up oracle db to accept connections from internet.
2. I am planning to use firebase as backend for this program.

## Why Firebase?
1. It is free.
2. Easy to integrate into projects.
3. Previously I have integrated firebase into [webpage](https://github.com/anirudhp06/Web/tree/master/prepaid-card-manager)
4. It's secure, so even if someone sees my api token on github, they can't do anything with it as firebase has its own security rules so only authorised device can access the data.
5. This `readme.md` will be updated with link of new expenditure project when its finished or when am developing it.
